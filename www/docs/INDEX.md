# Welcome to In Control!

In Control is a dashboard, datalogger, & debug utility for FIRST robotics teams, built from Advantage Kit, Advantage 
Scope, & Ico

## Getting Started

These links cover the basics of getting around in In Control and and accessing data.

- [App Navigation](/docs/NAVIGATION.md)
- [Opening/Downloading Log Files](/docs/OPEN-FILE.md)
- [Connecting to Live Sources](/docs/OPEN-LIVE.md)
- [Exporting Log Data](/docs/EXPORT.md)

## Tab Information

In Control supports many ways to view and analyze data, organized into tabs. The type of visualization is selectable for
each new tab opened, and multiple tabs of a given type can be open at once. Tabs can be named for ease of organization 
and many can be popped out separate windows for simultaneous, synchronized data viewing. If you need multiple tabs 
without the popout option opening multiple instances of the app is recommended.
